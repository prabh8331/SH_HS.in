## Setup MQTT

```yml
version: '3.7'
services:
  mosquitto:
    image: eclipse-mosquitto
    container_name: mosquitto
    volumes:
      - /opt/mosquitto:/mosquitto
      - /opt/mosquitto/data:/mosquitto/data
      - /opt/mosquitto/log:/mosquitto/log
    ports:
      - 1883:1883
      - 9001:9001 
    restart: unless-stopped

# volumes for mapping data,config and log
volumes:
  config:
  data:
  log:

networks:
  default:
    name: mqtt5-network

```

```bash
sudo mkdir mosquitto
cd /opt/mosquitto
sudo mkdir config
cd /opt/mosquitto/config

sudo nano mosquitto.conf
```
paste following - 

```conf
persistence true
persistence_location /mosquitto/data/
log_dest stdout
log_dest file /mosquitto/log/mosquitto.log
log_type warning
log_timestamp true
connection_messages true

listener 1883

## Authentication ##
#allow_anonymous false
#password_file /mosquitto/config/password.txt

```

```bash
cd /opt/mosquitto
sudo docker compose up -d
```

### Authentication process
from portainer open console -- (select sh console)

`docker exec -it mosquitto sh`
```bash
mosquitto_passwd -c /mosquitto/config/password.txt userver
# enter password -- 8331, then exit
exit
```

now again go to mosquitto.config and uncomment the Authentication 
```bash
## Authentication ##
allow_anonymous false
password_file /mosquitto/config/password.txt
```

restart mosquitto from portainer 


### Integrate mqtt with homeassistant

go to setting --> Device & Services --> new integration 
search mqtt
enter ip address(broker- 192.168.1.111) and (username - userver) and (pass- 8331)



## Frigate setup

```bash
cd /opt
sudo mkdir frigate

cd /opt/frigate
sudo mkdir media

sudo mkdir config
# cd /opt/frigate/config

cd /opt/frigate
sudo nano docker-compose.yaml
```

```yml

```

```bash
cd /opt/frigate/config
sudo nano config.yml

```

```yml

### Integrate frigate with homeassistant



1. SETUP HACS

this is the documentaiton - 
https://hacs.xyz/DOCS/SETUP/DOWNLOAD

    Open a terminal
    
    Go inside the container with 
    
    OR CAN GO TO PORTAINER AND OPEN CONCOLE 
    Run the HACS download script

```bash
docker exec -it homeassistant bash
wget -O - https://get.hacs.xyz | bash -


```

go to setting --> Device & Services --> add integratoin --> search hacs and install 


HACS WILL ASK FOR GIT VARIFICATION

---- FROM HACS INSTALL FRIGATE INTEGRATION AND RESTART THE SYSTEM

---- HACS FROUNT END - FRIGATE CARD - 
COPY THE FOLLOWING 


Lovelace YAML users

If Lovelace is in YAML mode then there's an additional step required to load the resource into your browser. (This mode is not the default -- you would seemode: yaml under lovelace: in your configuration.yaml if this applies to you),

    Add the following to configuration.yaml (note that /hacsfiles/ is just an optimized equivalent of /local/community/ that HACS natively supports):

lovelace:
  resources:
    - url: /hacsfiles/frigate-hass-card/frigate-hass-card.js
      type: module

Restart Home Assistant.
    Add the new card to the Lovelace configuration!


go to Device & Services --> add integratoin --> search frigate -- > enter Ip address
